# PingPong
Ping Pong game made with Javascript, HTML &amp; CSS.

Had a lot of fun putting this project together. Ran into many frustrations since this was my first time building
something with these tools, but getting it all working in the end was very rewarding. There is definitely room for 
improvement in optimizating this code and adhering to conventions in Javascript, HTML & CSS. My code is mostly
a result of me learning as I went.

All code is original except for the CSS styling of the "Ping Pong" title at the top.
